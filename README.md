# reinforcement_learning

Here I have explored a game environment present in OpenAI gym.

The game is called "Frozen Lake". In it, the agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile.

Using Q-learning, I learned the rewards associated with each action and state, then I have played the game with the learnings to achieve a good total reward on an average.
